All credit goes to Richard from [webscraping.com](http://webscraping.com). I found his  [blog post](http://webscraping.com/blog/Importing-CSV-into-MySQL/) while looking for such a tool. 


csv2mysql.py automatically parses a CSV file, creates MySQL table with appropriate field types, and then writes CSV data to the table.
