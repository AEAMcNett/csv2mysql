All credit goes to Richard from (webscraping.com)webscraping.com. I found this  (http://webscraping.com/blog/Importing-CSV-into-MySQL/)blog post while looking for this sort of solution.


csv2mysql.py automatically parses a CSV file, creates MySQL table with appropriate field types, and then writes CSV data to the table.
